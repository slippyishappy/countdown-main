# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer solution

This is a solution to the [Launch countdown timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-).

### The challenge

The coders should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (I made it count until 26 September)
